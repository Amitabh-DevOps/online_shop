## 🔧 Workflow 1: `deploy.yml` - Infrastructure Provisioning & Application Deployment

### Triggers
- ✅ Push to `final` branch
- ✅ Manual dispatch via GitHub Actions UI

### Jobs & Steps

#### 1. 🐳 Build & Push Docker Image
- Builds Docker image from your application
- Tags with branch name, SHA, and latest
- Pushes to Docker Hub with caching optimization
- Outputs image tags and digest for next jobs

#### 2. 🏗️ Provision Infrastructure (Terraform)
- Initializes Terraform with AWS provider
- Creates comprehensive AWS infrastructure:
  - **EC2 Instance**: Amazon Linux 2023 with Docker pre-installed
  - **Security Group**: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), SSH (22), App (3000)
  - **IAM Role & Instance Profile**: CloudWatch logging permissions
  - **Key Pair**: Auto-generated for SSH access
  - **CloudWatch Log Group**: Application and system logging
- Outputs instance IP and ID for deployment

#### 3. 🚀 Deploy Application
- Connects to EC2 via SSH using auto-generated key
- Installs and configures Docker on the instance
- Pulls the built Docker image from Docker Hub
- Runs containerized application on port 80
- Performs health checks to verify deployment

#### 4. 📊 Deployment Summary
- Generates comprehensive deployment report
- Shows all created resources and access URLs
- Provides SSH commands and troubleshooting info

## 🗑️ Workflow 2: `destroy.yml` - Infrastructure Teardown

### Triggers
- ✅ Manual dispatch ONLY (safety measure)
- ✅ Requires typing "DESTROY" to confirm

### Jobs & Steps

#### 1. 🔍 Validate Destruction Request
- Validates confirmation input ("DESTROY")
- Shows warning about permanent resource deletion
- Safety measure to prevent accidental destruction

#### 2. 💾 Pre-Destruction Backup
- Exports current Terraform state to JSON
- Creates backup artifacts with 30-day retention
- Ensures recovery possibility if needed

#### 3. 🗑️ Destroy Infrastructure
- Uses Terraform to destroy all AWS resources
- Supports force destroy option for stuck resources
- Handles resource dependencies properly
- Cleans up Terraform state files

#### 4. ✅ Post-Destruction Verification
- Verifies all resources are properly cleaned up
- Checks for any remaining EC2 instances or security groups
- Generates destruction report with status

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Components

### AWS Resources Created
- **EC2 Instance**: t3.micro (free tier eligible)
- **Security Group**: Web application access rules
- **IAM Role**: Least privilege for CloudWatch logging
- **Key Pair**: SSH access (auto-generated)
- **CloudWatch Log Group**: Application monitoring

### Security Features
- ✅ Encrypted EBS volumes
- ✅ IAM roles with minimal permissions
- ✅ Security groups with specific port access
- ✅ Auto-generated SSH keys
- ✅ CloudWatch logging and monitoring

### Networking
- Uses default VPC for simplicity
- Public subnet with internet gateway access
- Security group allows HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and app ports
- Configurable CIDR blocks for access restriction

## 🔐 Required GitHub Secrets

You need to configure these secrets in your GitHub repository:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID       # Your AWS Access Key ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   # Your AWS Secret Access Key
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME      # Your Docker Hub username
DOCKERHUB_TOKEN         # Your Docker Hub access token
EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY     # SSH private key (auto-generated by workflow)
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Run the automated setup script
./scripts/setup-cicd.sh

# Or validate your setup
./scripts/validate-setup.sh
```

### 2. Deploy Your Application
```bash
# Method 1: Push to final branch
git checkout -b final
git push origin final

# Method 2: Manual trigger from GitHub Actions UI
```

### 3. Access Your Application
- **Application URL**: `http://<instance-ip>` (shown in workflow output)
- **Health Check**: `http://<instance-ip>/health`
- **SSH Access**: Use command from workflow output

### 4. Destroy Infrastructure (when needed)
1. Go to GitHub Actions → "🗑️ Destroy Infrastructure"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Type "DESTROY" to confirm
4. Click "Run workflow"

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Built-in Monitoring
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Disk usage
- **Application Logs**: Forwarded to CloudWatch
- **System Health**: Automated monitoring script
- **Container Status**: Docker health checks

### Access Logs
```bash
# SSH into instance
ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@<instance-ip>

# Check application logs
sudo docker logs online-shop

# View system information
/opt/online-shop/system-info.sh
```

## 💰 Cost Optimization

### Default Configuration
- **Instance**: t3.micro (free tier eligible)
- **Storage**: 20GB GP3 encrypted volume
- **Monitoring**: Basic CloudWatch (free tier)
- **Estimated Cost**: ~$0-8/month (depending on usage)

### Cost Control Features
- Automatic resource cleanup with destroy workflow
- Right-sized instances for development
- Efficient Docker image caching
- Minimal resource provisioning

## 🔒 Security Best Practices Implemented

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Encrypted storage volumes
- ✅ IAM roles with least privilege
- ✅ Security groups with minimal access
- ✅ Auto-generated SSH keys
- ✅ VPC with proper networking

### CI/CD Security
- ✅ GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in code
- ✅ Secure Docker image handling
- ✅ Terraform state management
- ✅ Confirmation required for destruction

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### Environment Variables (in workflows)
```yaml
AWS_REGION: us-east-1          # Change AWS region
EC2_INSTANCE_TYPE: t3.micro    # Change instance size
TERRAFORM_VERSION: 1.6.0       # Terraform version
```

### Terraform Variables
```hcl
# terraform/terraform.tfvars
aws_region         = "us-west-2"
instance_type      = "t3.small"
environment        = "production"
allowed_cidr_blocks = ["YOUR.IP.ADDRESS/32"]  # Restrict access
```
